    <h2>The Story Behind</h2>
    <p>
        Almost twenty years ago, 2007, the physics students Niclas Moldenhauer, Moritz Feyerabend, Enno Harms and
        Hinnrich Thehinnie founded the "Olfrat" in a constitutional assembly in the Web 2.0 tower in Braunschweig.
        Inspired by the unwavering happiness and optimism of one of their co-students, Olf, especially in situations of
        intense stress or great danger, the main objective of the newly founded organization was to spread the
        philosophy of life that Olf demonstrated without knowing. In essence, this philosophy fosters conscious
        gratitude about the good aspects of life and a stoic view on the challenges and hurdles to be taken by everyone.
        This is mostly achieved by a mindset of steady learning and training of both body and soul, with the ultimate
        goal to become a more conscious and capable human being.

    <h2>Today's Business</h2>
    <p>
        After the initial period of a community that gathered for fun and games, a business was formed that
        professionalizes the effort on improving the lives of normal citizens by researching intelligent digital
        solutions for day-to-day problems. The core values of our team still orient today on the philosophy shaped by
        Olf 20 years ago: fun, growth, and happiness.
